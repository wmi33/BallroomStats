# BallroomStats
## Description
This project is designed to provide detailed statistics about Dancesport dancers using data provided by BallroomCompExpress.com
## How to Install and Run
You can download or clone the repository through this webpage. From there, I ran this application using Python 3.11.4.
## How to Use
To run this application, run the command:

python3 scape.py

To scape the data from the webpage and convert it into objects. I am looking to move this data to a local database because the dataset will become too large to efficiently read through a file.
